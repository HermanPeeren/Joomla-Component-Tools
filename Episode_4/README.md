# Episode 4: Bells & Whistles + some set-up tools

## Nested admin menu
We added the possibility to add different schedules, for instance for different editions of a festival. 
All entities belong to only one such a schedule. So it would be convenient and more clear if we don't have to select 
for each entity to what schedule it belongs, but as soon as we have chosen a schedule, only then we get a sub-menu with 
containers, sections, events, event types, and actors. The schedule should be in a hidden field (or being shown read-only).

Therefore the containers, sections, events, event types, and actors should NOT be in the left panel menu in the 
administrator, but in a special menu (or tabs) on top of the administrator part of the component.
